<h2 align="center"><strong>What is the CUB3D?</strong></h2>

This project is inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, a game that uses 2.5D graphics and raycasting to create the illusion of 3D. The goal of this project is to develop a similar game where players can navigate through a maze, change the direction of the camera, and alter the texture of the walls.
<h1 align="center"><strong></strong>How to use</h1>

- Clone the repository
- Run `make` to compile the library
- execute the program with `./cub3D maps/[map.cub]`

You can walk through the maze using the `WASD` keys and rotate the camera using the left and right arrow keys. Also you can change the texture of the walls by changing the `NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA` paths in the map file.
